## Bug reporting
To report a bug With core Scripts(No plugins)
Just do it right here in our respository.

# CoreRun

The CoreRun script is the core of your chassis/Bus and should not be touched.
The core run manages most of everything there and logs it. If you run the chassis/bus in studio you can copy the values and you can send in a detailed report also copy all log outputs in the roblox studio output tab and dont worry if you have 0 acsess to a computer it also logs the value outputs in console(This is toggleable in the chassis settings menu under ConsoleOutput)

There are three types of plugins
- A-chassis Plugins

# A-chassis Plugins

## For plugin creators
!IT IS RECOMMENDED TO OBFUSCATE YOUR SCRIPTS!
Why do i recomend this its because of leakers If you obfuscate they cant really steal your work Dont obfuscate the manifest modeule script for your plugins as it might mess up loading.
